    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm TheDecentralizedVeteran, a Marine Corps Veteran dedicated to promoting decentralized technologies to enhance privacy, security, and freedom of expression—values I cherish as an American and defender of freedom.</p>

    <h2>About This Repository</h2>
    <p>This repository is dedicated to helping non-tech related people like myself contribute to decentralization because that's how we get better as a society and move forward. Our mission is to empower everyone to participate in building a decentralized future.</p>
    <p>Through this project, we aim to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Promote Privacy:</strong> Implement solutions that protect user data and communication from unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance Security:</strong> Develop tools and protocols that fortify defenses against cyber threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Uphold Freedom of Expression:</strong> Ensure everyone has the ability to communicate and express themselves freely without censorship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is a NIP?</strong> A NIP is a Nostr Improvement Proposal; these are basically tech specs that are proposed as upgrades for the Nostr protocol.</li>
            <li><strong>What is NIP-05?</strong> NIP-05 is a verification method for your Nostr account across all clients. Think of it as the blue checkmark on Twitter or Instagram, but instead of meeting Twitter and later Instagram’s requirements to be verified, you can simply do it yourself, and Nostr clients will respect it.</li>
        </ul>
